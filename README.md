# AWS Limits Exporter

This is a small Go server that provides a Prometheus metrics endpoint that
exposes AWS usage and limits as reported by the AWS Trusted Advisor API.


## Usage

There are Docker images ready for use:

```bash
# Start exporter container
$ docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<KEY> -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<SECRET> \
      danielfm/aws-limits-exporter:latest -logtostderr -region=<REGION>

# Scrape metrics
$ curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

## AWS Credentials

For this to work, it must have access to AWS credentials in
`~/.aws/credentials`, or via `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
environment variables.

The following IAM policy describes which actions the user must be able to
perform in order for this server to work:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "support:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
